Here are the basic steps to build a crawler:
 Step 1: Add one or several URLs to be visited.
 Step 2: Pop a link from the URLs to be visited and add it to the Visited URLs thread.
 Step 3: Fetch the page's content and scrape the data you're interested in with the ScrapingBot API.
 Step 4: Parse all the URLs present on the page, and add them to the URLs to be visited if they match the rules you've set and don't match any of
          the Visited URLs.
 Step 5: Repeat steps 2 to 4 until the URLs to be visited list is empty.

Here are the steps to save the images and text from the website
Step 1: Start with content. As a starting point, we’ll write up raw text content and see what browsers do with it.
Step 2: Give the document structure. You’ll learn about HTML element syntax and the elements that give a document its structure.
Step 3: Identify text elements. You’ll describe the content using the appropriate text elements and learn about the proper way to use HTML.
Step 4: Add an image. By adding an image to the page, you’ll learn about attributes and empty elements.
Step 5: Change the page appearance with a style sheet. This exee gives you a taste of formatting content with Cascading Style Sheets.
